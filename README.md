# Portfolio Projects

## Idea

You will be working on one of the following clones:

- [Social Media](socialmedia/README.md)
- [Ecommerce Marketplace](ecommerce/README.md) 

## Design & Planning (Week 1)

#### Overview

- This first stage is about taking your idea and creating a concrete plan of execution. 
- The most important thing here is to have a schedule and try to stick to it. Even if you don't, your schedule will keep you honest.
- You will see that each week builds off of the previous, so it's critical to keep your pace.

#### Tasks

- Create a Trello Board.
  - Create three columns: "Not Started", "In Progress/Reviewed", and "Finished"
  - Use tags for your tasks such as: Design, Planning, Development, Bug, Enhancement
- Create a brand. Use the idea to create your product brand. Come up with a name, color scheme and overall vision for your product.
- Using the wireframes: you will either need to design mockups for your project OR use pure HTML & CSS to create each page.
  - If you aren't design savvy it's recommended you go the HTML & CSS route.
  - The HTML / CSS does not need to be perfect, we just need some sort of foundation for you to work off of.
- Understand each page and the functional requirements.

## Develop Backend (Week 2)

#### Overview

- This is the stage you think about all the APIs, database tables and overall flow of information.
- You may not need a CRUD for every Model
- We can worry about authentication middleware later

#### Tasks

- Figure out what are all your data Models.
- Use your data Models to create a Database Schema.
- Use your Database Schema to create your `seed.sql` file
- Look at each page of your application and figure out what API call each page will call.
- Those are the APIs you will be implementing using our Express project structure:
  - `/routes`
  - `/services`
- Test your APIs as you build them. 

## Develop Frontend (Week 3 & 4)

#### Overview

- This is the stage you will take your mockups and/or HTML&CSS to create your React components.
- Layout your application Routes and Structure.
- Understand which pages have what containers & components
- Understand how to make API calls to your backend APIs
- You will implement Authentication using Firebase

#### Tasks

- Create Single Page React App
  - Layout your application structure and routes
- Use your HTML & CSS mockups to make React components
- Implement Firebase Authentication and File Storage where it's needed
- Integrate your APIs from the backend to the pages and containers
- Test your application as you go
- Figure out how to secure your Routes & backend API calls using Firebase authentication

## Testing, Polishing & Deployment (Week 5)

- This is the stage you will cover any loose ends
- Integrate any security features or performance upgrades
- Thoroughly test your application for bugs
- Deploy your application
